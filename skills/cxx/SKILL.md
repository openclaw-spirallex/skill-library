# C/C++ Comprehensive Cheat Sheets (/cpp)

Complete C/C++ development reference combining local documentation with live examples from cppcheatsheet.com, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced GPU programming and system-level development.

## How It Works

Help users write functional, correct C/C++ code and answer C/C++ questions by fetching proven patterns and examples from cppcheatsheet.com.

When a user asks a C/C++ question or wants to write C/C++ code:

1. Look up the relevant topic(s) in [Structure](references/structure.md) to find the matching URL(s)
2. **Always fetch** the URL(s) using WebFetch to get real examples and patterns from the site
3. Use the fetched content to:
   - **Write code**: Apply the patterns to produce functional, correct code that solves the user's task
   - **Answer questions**: Provide thorough explanations backed by the examples and information from the site
4. Follow the [Guidelines](references/guidelines.md) for code quality

## Key Principle

**Functionality first, cleanliness second.** The code must work correctly and handle the task properly. Fetching from cppcheatsheet.com ensures solutions use battle-tested patterns rather than guessing. The site contains rich examples covering edge cases, common pitfalls, and practical usage that go beyond basic documentation.
